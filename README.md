### Description:

In embedded 3D printing, a nozzle is embedded into a support bath and extrudes filaments or droplets into the bath. Using OpenFOAM, we simulated the extrusion of filaments and droplets into a moving bath. OpenFOAM is an open source computational fluid dynamics solver. This repository contains the following Python tools:

- Tools for generating input files for OpenFOAM v1912 or OpenFOAM v8 tailored to a nozzle extruding a filament into a static support bath.
- Tools for monitoring the status of OpenFOAM simulations and aborting them if they are too slow.
- Tools for moving output files between storage locations. (For example, it can automatically move all files to a server, but only necessary files to your hard drive)
- Tools for generating images and tables from the 3D time series.
- Tools for compiling images into videos.
- Tools for analyzing, summarizing, and plotting data.

The OpenFOAM input file tools are compatible with OpenFOAM v1912 and OpenFOAM v8. Between the two versions, OpenFOAM did change the syntax on a couple of input variables, so you may need to update ncreate3d.py for future versions of OpenFOAM. Between the two versions, OpenFOAM also modified the way they output paraview files. In v1912, OpenFOAM generated a .vtm file and folder for each time step, and compiled all of the timesteps into a .vtm.series file that could easily be imported into Paraview. In v8, OpenFOAM generates a .vtk file for each time step but does not generate a .series file. folderparser.py has a function generateVTKSeries that generates these .series files, which make it easy to load the whole time series in Paraview.

# Usage

For full functionality, you will need to make the following files:

- Copy configs/config_template.yml and call it configs/config.yml. Change the path names to the paths to your data.
- To use the paraview scripts, you will need to establish a virtual environment:

```
python -m virtualenv ./env
.\env\scripts\activate
FOR /F "delims=~" %f in (requirements.txt) DO pip install "%f" || conda install --yes "%f"
deactivate
```

# METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION


This repository is linked with the paper and dataset linked at the top of this document. Typical workflow for a Windows desktop for a single parent folder (e.g. HBHBsweep) was as follows:

1.
    1. In JupyterLab, generate input files using noz3dscript.ipynb and ncreate3d.py. For each simulation, this generates legend.csv, geometry.csv, case, 0, constant, system, Allclean, Allrun, Continue. For the parent folder, this generates mesh and geometry files. 

    2. (optional file generation) Move files to server and other computers, if needed.

2. In Ubuntu, edit the bash script runallfiles.sh to include appropriate number of processes, correct list of folders. In Ubuntu, run runallfiles.sh in background. This starts the simulations running. (bash runallfiles.sh &). OpenFOAM will generate 0.1, 0.2, ..., VTK, and logs during this process.

3.
    1. In Anaconda powershell or JupyterLab, run donescript.py on each computer while simulations are running (python3 donescript.py [parentfolder]). This watches the simulations and aborts them using case/system/controlDict if they are too slow. In newer versions, donescript.py is implemented inside of runallfiles.sh.

    2. (optional file management) Modify movescript.py to look at relevant folders. In Anaconda powershell or JupyterLab, run movescript.py on each computer while simulations are running or after they are done (python3 movescript.py X, where X is the number of hours to wait between loops). This moves simulation results to the server.

4.
    1. Modify comboscript.py to include relevant folders and desired image types. Turn on waiting to let this script run continuously. In Command Prompt, run ([path]\pvpython.exe [path]\comboscript.py). Do this while simulations are running or after they are done. This generates images and interfacePoints.

    2. (optional image generation) Modify videoscript.py to look at relevant folders. In Anaconda powershell or JupyterLab, run videoscript.py to consolidate images into videos (python3 videoscript.py). Do this while images are being generated or after they are done. 

5.
    1. In JupyterLab, use interfacemetrics_viscsweep.ipynb to generate sliceSummaries.csv, steadyPositions.csv, and steadyTimes.csv.

    2. In JupyterLab, use interfacemetrics_viscsweep.ipynb to make plots.
